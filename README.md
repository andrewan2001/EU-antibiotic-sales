Antibiotic resistance presents a serious problem to global health. In part it is 
due to the use of antibiotics in livestock, which tend to receive similar antibiotics 
to humans - known as medically important antibiotics. Essentially, use of antibiotics 
has been used for growth promotion and feed efficiency to produce larger animals 
with less feed costs. The European countries have monitored antibiotic sale 
since 2010 to better understand this issue. The following analysis is based on
the European Medicines Agency's European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial 
Consumption database (ESVAC) and captures sale data from 2010 - 2021. The following 
visualizes total antibiotic sale for livestock in all and top 8 highest using European countries 
and determine if there have been significant reductions to antibiotic sale in the past decade.
